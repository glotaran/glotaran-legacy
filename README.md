## Deprecation notice

The 1.0.0 version of Glotaran was released more than 13 years ago, and the creators of Glotaran think it's time for a change. For the past few years they have been working on a successor for Glotaran, re-written from the ground up in Python, called [pyglotaran](https://github.com/glotaran/pyglotaran). Please check it out!

## Latest releases

### Stable (1.5.x)

Latest stable release on [glotaran.org](http://glotaran.org/downloads) is version 1.5.1.

### Next release (1.6.x)

Version 1.6.0 will be updating the NetBeans Platform framework to version 12.6 (from 8.0.2).

### Developer builds (1.7.x)

The goal of 1.7.0 is to release something that works with the latest LTS of Java and NetBeans, which should give it another 5 years or runtime, by which time it is expected to be fully replace with pyglotaran and GUIs implemented for it.
